Title: Pipe operator and functions
Version: 0.5.2
Author: Kun Ren <ken@renkun.me>
Maintainer: Kun Ren <ken@renkun.me>
Description: Provides various styles of function chaining methods: Pipe operator,
    Pipe object, and pipeline function, each representing a distinct pipeline
    model yet sharing almost a common set of features: A value can be piped to
    the first unnamed argument of a function, to dot symbol in an enclosed expression,
    by formula as lambda expression, for side-effect, and with assignment.
    The set of syntax is designed to make the pipeline more readable and fluent to
    a wide variety of operations.
Depends:
